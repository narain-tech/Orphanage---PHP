                    <h3>WE ARE SO GLAD TO HAVE HERE!</h3>
					<p>Our organization’s history is one of great adventures, overcoming huge odds and most importantly love. 
                        Non-profit organizations rarely have a story to tell like ours does; 
                        some might find parts of it hard to believe but we assure you, it is all truth.</p> <br>
                        <p><bold>BISHOP ORPHANAGE HOME</bold> was founded in 1948 by Maxton Davis Strong and his wife, Shirley.
                             Maxton Strong had been a professor of Agricultural Engineering at the Allahabad Agricultural Institute in India.
                              Maxton was a US citizen but became an Indian citizen in 1983 by naturalization.</p> <br>
                              <p>After seeing the need of practical “hands on” agricultural training for aspiring young farmers, he acquired 160 acres of good fertile land along the foothills of the Himalayas, which was being offered to him by the Indian Government. 
                              It was there that he would start his social work, educating and uplifting people from rural communities.</p>
